# jitsiurl

A quick and easy way client-side way to generate Jitsi Meet URLs in the style
of the [public Jitsi Meet server](https://meet.jit.si/).

## But... why?

Want to set aside a Jitsi URL for a meeting in advance but don't want to open
up a web application just to do that? Do you find yourself doing that _often_?
This is the way to go.

## Usage

In your favorite terminal emulator...

```sh
$ jitsiurl
https://meet.jit.si/RuthlessFungiParticipatePromptly
```

Boom.

## Tips and tricks

If you're on macOS, you can just pipe it to `pbcopy` and get it into your
clipboard for easy pasting, like so:

```sh
$ jitsiurl | pbcopy
```

If you're on GNU/Linux, use something like [xsel](http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/)
to achieve a similar effect. You'll probably need to install that in most distributions.

```sh
$ jitsiurl | xsel --clipboard --input
```

Probably easier to make an alias for that if you use this a lot.

## Installation

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/edenemmanuel/jitsiurl.git
```

...and then put it where you like to put your scripts, and you'll be good to go.
